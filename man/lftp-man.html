<b>VERSION</b>
       This man page documents lftp version 4.3.4.


<b>DESCRIPTION</b>
       <b>lftp</b>  is a file transfer program that allows sophisticated ftp, http and other connections to
       other hosts. If <i>site</i> is specified then lftp will connect to that site otherwise a  connection
       has to be established with the open command.

       <b>lftp</b>  can  handle  several file access methods - ftp, ftps, http, https, hftp, fish, sftp and
       file (https and ftps are only available when  lftp  is  compiled  with  GNU  TLS  or  OpenSSL
       library).   You   can   specify  the  method  to  use  in  `open  URL'  command,  e.g.  `open
       <a href="http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux">http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux</a>'. hftp is ftp-over-http-proxy protocol.  It  can  be  used
       automatically instead of ftp if ftp:proxy is set to `http://proxy[:port]'. Fish is a protocol
       working over an ssh connection to a unix account. SFtp is a protocol implemented in  ssh2  as
       sftp subsystem.

       Besides  FTP-like  protocols,  lftp has support for BitTorrent protocol as `torrent' command.
       Seeding is also supported.


       Every operation in <b>lftp</b> is reliable, that is any not fatal error is ignored and the operation
       is  repeated.  So  if  downloading breaks, it will be restarted from the point automatically.
       Even if ftp server does not support REST command, <b>lftp</b> will try to retrieve the file from the
       very beginning until the file is transferred completely.

       <b>lftp</b>  has  shell-like  command  syntax allowing you to launch several commands in parallel in
       background (&amp;). It is also possible to group commands within () and  execute  them  in  back‐
       ground.  All  background  jobs are executed in the same single process. You can bring a fore‐
       ground job to background with ^Z (c-z) and back with command `wait' (or `fg' which  is  alias
       to  `wait').  To list running jobs, use command `jobs'. Some commands allow redirecting their
       output (cat, ls, ...) to file or via pipe to external command. Commands can be executed  con‐
       ditionally based on termination status of previous command (&amp;&amp;, ||).

       If  you exit <b>lftp</b> when some jobs are not finished yet, <b>lftp</b> will move itself to nohup mode in
       background. The same happens when you have a real modem hangup or when you close an xterm.

       <b>lftp</b> has built-in mirror which can download or update a whole directory tree. There  is  also
       reverse  mirror  (mirror  -R) which uploads or updates a directory tree on server. Mirror can
       also synchronize directories between two remote servers, using FXP if available.

       There is command `at' to launch a job at specified time in current context,  command  `queue'
       to queue commands for sequential execution for current server, and much more.

       On  startup,  <b>lftp</b>  executes  <i>/etc/lftp.conf</i> and then <i>~/.lftprc</i> and <i>~/.lftp/rc</i>. You can place
       aliases and `set' commands there. Some people prefer to see full protocol debug, use  `debug'
       to turn the debug on. Use `debug 3' to see only greeting messages and error messages.

       <b>lftp</b>  has a number of settable variables. You can use `set -a' to see all variables and their
       values or `set -d' to see list of defaults.  Variable names can be abbreviated and prefix can
       be omitted unless the rest becomes ambiguous.

       If  lftp  was  compiled  with  OpenSSL  (configure --with-openssl), then it includes software
       developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit. (http://www.openssl.org/)


   <b>Commands</b>
       <b>!</b> <i>shell</i> <i>command</i>

       Launch shell or shell command.

            !ls

       To do a directory listing of the local host.

       <b>alias</b>  [<i>name</i> [<i>value</i>]]

       Define or undefine alias <i>name</i>. If <i>value</i> is omitted, the alias is undefined, else it takes the
       value <i>value</i>. If no argument is given the current aliases are listed.

            alias dir ls -lF
            alias less zmore

       <b>at</b> <i>time</i> [ -- <i>command</i> ]

       Wait until the given time and execute given (optional) command. See also <b>at</b>(1).

       <b>attach</b>  [<i>PID</i>]

       Attach the terminal to specified backgrounded lftp process.

       <b>bookmark</b>  [<i>subcommand</i>]

       The bookmark command controls bookmarks.

            add &lt;name&gt; [&lt;loc&gt;]   add  current place or given location to bookmarks and bind to given
                                 name
            del &lt;name&gt;           remove bookmark with name
            edit                 start editor on bookmarks file
            import &lt;type&gt;        import foreign bookmarks
            list                 list bookmarks (default)

       <b>cache</b>  [<i>subcommand</i>]

       The cache command controls local memory cache.  The following subcommands are recognized:

            stat        print cache status (default)
            on|off      turn on/off caching
            flush       flush cache
            size <i>lim</i>    set memory limit, -1 means unlimited
            expire <i>Nx</i>   set cache expiration time to <i>N</i> seconds (<i>x</i>=s) minutes (<i>x</i>=m)  hours  (<i>x</i>=h)  or
                        days (<i>x</i>=d)

       <b>cat</b> <i>files</i>

       cat outputs the remote file(s) to stdout.  (See also <b>more</b>, <b>zcat</b> and <b>zmore</b>)

       <b>cd</b> rdir

       Change  current remote directory.  The previous remote directory is stored as `-'. You can do
       `cd -' to change the directory back.  The previous directory for each site is also stored  on
       disk, so you can do `open site; cd -' even after lftp restart.

       <b>chmod</b> <i>mode</i> <i>files</i>

       Change permission mask on remote files. The mode must be an octal number.

       <b>close</b> [<b>-a</b>]

       Close  idle  connections.   By default only with the current server, use -a to close all idle
       connections.

       <b>cls</b> [<b>OPTS</b>] <i>files...</i>

       `cls' tries to retrieve information about specified files  or  directories  and  outputs  the
       information  according  to format options. The difference between `ls' and `cls' is that `ls'
       requests the server to format file listing, and `cls' formats it itself, after retrieving all
       the needed information.  See `help cls' for options.

       <b>command</b> <i>cmd</i> <i>args...</i>

       execute given command ignoring aliases.

       <b>debug</b> [<b>-o</b> <i>file</i>] <i>level</i>|<b>off</b>

       Switch debugging to <i>level</i> or turn it off.  Use -o to redirect the debug output to a file.

       <b>echo</b> [<b>-n</b>] <i>string</i>

       guess what it does.

       <b>eval</b> [<b>-f</b> <i>format</i> ] <i>args...</i>

       without  -f it just executes given arguments as a command. With -f, arguments are transformed
       into a new command. The format can contain plain text and placeholders $0...$9 and $@, corre‐
       sponding to the arguments.

       <b>exit</b> [<b>bg</b>] [<b>top</b>] [<b>kill</b>] [<i>code</i>]

       exit will exit from lftp or move to background if there are active jobs. If no job is active,
       <i>code</i> is passed to operating system as lftp's termination status. If <i>code</i> is omitted, the exit
       code of last command is used.

       `exit  bg'  forces  moving to background when cmd:move-background is false.  `exit top' makes
       top level `shell' (internal lftp command executor) terminate.  `exit kill' kills all numbered
       jobs  before  exiting. The options can be combined, e.g.  `at 08:00 -- exit top kill &amp;' kills
       all jobs and makes lftp exit at specified time.

       <b>fg</b>

       Alias for `wait'.

       <b>find</b>  [<i>directory</i>]

       List files in the directory (current directory by default) recursively.  This can  help  with
       servers lacking ls -R support. You can redirect output of this command.

       <b>ftpcopy</b>

       Obsolete. Use one of the following instead:
            get ftp://... -o ftp://...
            get -O ftp://... file1 file2...
            put ftp://...
            mput ftp://.../*
            mget -O ftp://... ftp://.../*
       or  other  combinations  to  get FXP transfer (directly between two ftp servers).  lftp would
       fallback to plain copy (via client) if FXP transfer cannot be  initiated  or  ftp:use-fxp  is
       false.

       <b>get</b> [<b>-E</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-O</b> <i>base</i>] <i>rfile</i> [<b>-o</b> <i>lfile</i>] ...

       Retrieve  the  remote file <i>rfile</i> and store it as the local file <i>lfile</i>.  If -o is omitted, the
       file is stored to local file named as base name of <i>rfile</i>. You can get multiple files by spec‐
       ifying  multiple  instances  of <i>rfile</i> (and -o <i>lfile</i>). Does not expand wildcards, use <b>mget</b> for
       that.

            -c          continue, reget
            -E          delete source files after successful transfer
            -e          delete target file before the transfer
            -a          use ascii mode (binary is the default)
            -O &lt;base&gt;   specifies base directory or URL where files should be placed

       Examples:
            get README
            get README -o debian.README
            get README README.mirrors
            get README -o debian.README README.mirrors -o debian.mirrors
            get README -o ftp://some.host.org/debian.README
            get README -o ftp://some.host.org/debian-dir/   <b>(end</b> <b>slash</b> <b>is</b> <b>important)</b>

       <b>get1</b> [<i>OPTS</i>] <i>rfile</i>

       Transfer a single file. Options:

            -o &lt;lfile&gt;                  destination file name (default - basename of rfile)
            -c                          continue, reget
            -E                          delete source files after successful transfer
            -a                          use ascii mode (binary is the default)
            --source-region=&lt;from-to&gt;   transfer specified region of source file
            --target-position=&lt;pos&gt;     position in target file to write data at

       <b>glob</b> [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-f</b>] <i>command</i> <i>patterns</i>

       Glob given patterns containing metacharacters and pass result to given command.  E.g.  ``glob
       echo *''.

            -f   plain files (default)
            -d   directories
            -a   all types

       <b>help</b> [<i>cmd</i>]

       Print help for <i>cmd</i> or if no <i>cmd</i> was specified print a list of available commands.

       <b>jobs</b> [<b>-v</b>]

       <b>kill</b> all|<i>job</i>_<i>no</i>

       Delete specified job with <i>job</i>_<i>no</i> or all jobs.  (For <i>job</i>_<i>no</i> see <b>jobs</b>)

       <b>lcd</b> <i>ldir</i>

       Change  current  local directory <i>ldir</i>. The previous local directory is stored as `-'. You can
       do `lcd -' to change the directory back.

       <b>ln</b> [<b>-s</b>] <i>existing-file</i> <i>new-link</i>

       Make a hard/symbolic link to an existing file.  Option -s  selects  creation  of  a  symbolic
       link.

       <b>local</b> <i>command</i>

       Run  specified  command with local directory file:// session instead of remote session. Exam‐

       command.  By default, ls output is cached, to see new listing use <b>rels</b> or <b>cache</b> <b>flush.</b>

       <b>mget</b> [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-E</b>] [<b>-O</b> <i>base</i>] <i>files</i>

       Gets selected files with expanded wildcards.

       <b>mirror</b> [<i>OPTS</i>] [<i>source</i> [<i>target</i>]]

       Mirror specified source directory to local target directory. If target directory ends with  a
       slash, the source base name is appended to target directory name. Source and/or target can be
       URLs pointing to directories.

            -c,    --continue                continue a mirror job if possible
            -e,    --delete                  delete files not present at remote site
                   --delete-first            delete old files before transferring new ones
                   --depth-first             descend into subdirectories before transferring files
            -s,    --allow-suid              set suid/sgid bits according to remote site
                   --allow-chown             try to set owner and group on files

            -L,    --dereference             download symbolic links as files
            -N,    --newer-than=SPEC         download only files newer than specified time
                   --on-change=CMD           execute the command if anything has been changed

            -x <i>RX</i>, --exclude <i>RX</i>              exclude matching files
            -I <i>GP</i>, --include-glob <i>GP</i>         include matching files
            -X <i>GP</i>, --exclude-glob <i>GP</i>         exclude matching files
            -v,    --verbose[=level]         verbose operation
                   --log=FILE                write lftp commands being executed to FILE
                   --script=FILE             write lftp commands to FILE, but don't execute them
                   --just-print, --dry-run   same as --script=-
                   --use-cache               use cached directory listings
                   --Remove-source-files     remove files after transfer (use with caution)
            -a                               same as --allow-chown --allow-suid --no-umask

       When using -R, the first directory is local and the second is remote.  If the  second  direc‐
       tory is omitted, base name of first directory is used.  If both directories are omitted, cur‐
       rent local and remote directories are used.  If target directory ends with  a  slash  (except
       root directory) then base name of source directory is appended.

       <i>RX</i> is an extended regular expression, just like in <b>egrep</b>(1).

       <i>GP</i> is a glob pattern, e.g. `*.zip'.

       Include  and  exclude options can be specified multiple times. It means that a file or direc‐
       tory would be mirrored if it matches an include and does not  match  to  excludes  after  the
       include,  or  does not match anything and the first check is exclude. Directories are matched
       with a slash appended.

       Note that symbolic links are not created when uploading to remote server, because ftp  proto‐
       col  cannot  do  it. To upload files the links refer to, use `mirror -RL' command (treat sym‐
       bolic links as files).

       For option --newer-than you can either specify a file or time specification like that used by
       <b>at</b>(1)  command, e.g. `now-7days' or `week ago'. If you specify a file, then modification time
       of that file will be used.

       Verbosity level can be selected using --verbose=level option or by several -v  options,  e.g.
       -vvv. Levels are:
            0 - no output (default)
            1 - print actions
            2 - +print not deleted file names (when -e is not specified)
            3 - +print directory names which are mirrored

       --only-newer  turns  off  file size comparison and uploads/downloads only newer files even if
       size is different. By default older files are transferred and replace newer ones.

       You can mirror between two servers if you specify URLs instead of directories.  FXP  is  used
       automatically for transfers between ftp servers, if possible.

       Some  ftp  servers  hide  dot-files by default (e.g. <i>.htaccess</i>), and show them only when LIST
       command is used with -a option. In such case try to use `set ftp:list-options -a'.

       <b>mkdir</b> [<b>-p</b>] <i>dir(s)</i>

       Make remote directories. If -p is used, make all components of paths.

       <b>module</b> <i>module</i> [ <i>args</i> ]

       Load given module using <b>dlopen</b>(3) function. If module name does not contain a  slash,  it  is
       searched  in  directories  specified  by  module:path variable.  Arguments are passed to mod‐
       ule_init function. See README.modules for technical details.

       <b>more</b> <i>files</i>

       Same as `cat <i>files</i> | more'. if <b>PAGER</b> is set, it is used as filter.  (See also <b>cat</b>,  <b>zcat</b>  and
       <b>zmore</b>)

       <b>mput</b> [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-E</b>] [<b>-O</b> <i>base</i>] <i>files</i>

       Upload  files  with  wildcard  expansion.  By  default it uses the base name of local name as
       remote one. This can be changed by `-d' option.

            -c          continue, reput
            -d          create directories the same as in file names and put  the  files  into  them
                        instead of current directory
            -E          delete source files after successful transfer (dangerous)
            -a          use ascii mode (binary is the default)
            -O &lt;base&gt;   specifies base directory or URL where files should be placed

       <b>mrm</b> <i>file(s)</i>

       Same as `glob rm'. Removes specified file(s) with wildcard expansion.

       <b>mv</b> <i>file1</i> <i>file2</i>

       Rename <i>file1</i> to <i>file2</i>.

       <b>nlist</b> [<i>args</i>]

       List remote file names

       <b>open</b> [<b>-e</b> <i>cmd</i>] <b>[</b>-u <i>user</i><b>[</b>,<i>pass</i><b>]]</b> <b>[</b>-p <i>port</i><b>]</b> <i>host</i><b>|</b><i>url</i>

       Select an ftp server.

       <b>pget</b> [<i>OPTS</i>] <i>rfile</i> [<b>-o</b> <i>lfile</i>]

       Gets  the specified file using several connections. This can speed up transfer, but loads the
       net and server heavily impacting other users. Use only if you really  have  to  transfer  the
       file ASAP.  Options:

            -c           continue transfer. Requires <i>lfile.lftp-pget-status</i> file.
            -n <i>maxconn</i>   set  maximum  number  of  connections (default is taken from <b>pget:default-n</b>
                         setting)

       <b>put</b> [<b>-E</b>] [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-O</b> <i>base</i>] <i>lfile</i> [<b>-o</b> <i>rfile</i>]

       Upload <i>lfile</i> with remote name <i>rfile</i>. If -o omitted, the base name of <i>lfile</i> is used as  remote
       name. Does not expand wildcards, use <b>mput</b> for that.

            -o &lt;rfile&gt;   specifies remote file name (default - basename of lfile)
            -c           continue, reput. It requires permission to overwrite remote files
            -E           delete source files after successful transfer (dangerous)
            -a           use ascii mode (binary is the default)
            -O &lt;base&gt;    specifies base directory or URL where files should be placed

       <b>pwd</b> [<b>-p</b>]

       Print current remote URL. Use `-p' option to show password in the URL.

       <b>queue</b> [<b>-n</b> <i>num</i> ] <i>cmd</i>

       Add  the  given  command to queue for sequential execution. Each site has its own queue. `-n'
       adds the command before the given item in the queue. Don't try to queue `cd'  or  `lcd'  com‐
       mands,  it may confuse lftp. Instead do the cd/lcd before `queue' command, and it will remem‐
       ber the place in which the command is to be done. It is possible to queue up an already  run‐
       ning  job  by `queue wait &lt;jobno&gt;', but the job will continue execution even if it is not the
       first in queue.

       `queue stop' will stop the queue, it will not execute any new commands, but  already  running
       jobs  will continue to run. You can use `queue stop' to create an empty stopped queue. `queue
       start' will resume queue execution.  When you exit lftp, it will  start  all  stopped  queues
       automatically.

       `queue' with no arguments will either create a stopped queue or print queue status.

       <b>queue</b> <b>--delete|-d</b> [<i>index</i> <i>or</i> <i>wildcard</i> <i>expression</i>]

       Delete one or more items from the queue. If no argument is given, the last entry in the queue
       is deleted.

       <b>queue</b> <b>--move|-m</b> &lt;<i>index</i> <i>or</i> <i>wildcard</i> <i>expression</i>&gt; [<i>index</i>]

       Move the given items before the given queue index, or to the end if no destination is given.

            -q   Be quiet.
            -v   Be verbose.
            -Q   Output in a format that can be used to re-queue. Useful with --delete.

       Examples:
            &gt; get file &amp;
            [1] get file
            &gt; queue wait 1
            &gt; queue get another_file
            &gt; cd a_directory
            &gt; queue get yet_another_file

            queue -d 3             Delete the third item in the queue.
            queue -m 6 4           Move the sixth item in the queue before the fourth.
            queue -m "get*zip" 1   Move all commands matching "get*zip"  to  the  beginning  of  the
                                   queue.  (The order of the items is preserved.)
            queue -d "get*zip"     Delete all commands matching "get*zip".

       <b>quote</b> <i>cmd</i>

       For  FTP  -  send the command uninterpreted. Use with caution - it can lead to unknown remote
       state and thus will cause reconnect. You cannot be sure  that  any  change  of  remote  state
       because of quoted command is solid - it can be reset by reconnect at any time.

       For  HTTP  -  specific  to HTTP action. Syntax: ``quote &lt;command&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]''.  Command may be
       ``set-cookie'' or ``post''.
            open http://www.site.net
            quote set-cookie "variable=value; othervar=othervalue"
            set http:post-content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded
            quote post /cgi-bin/script.cgi "var=value&amp;othervar=othervalue" &gt; local_file

       For FISH - send the command uninterpreted. This can be used to execute arbitrary commands  on
       server.  The  command must not take input or print ### at new line beginning. If it does, the
       protocol will become out of sync.
            open fish://server
            quote find -name \*.zip

       <b>reget</b> <i>rfile</i> [<b>-o</b> <i>lfile</i>]

       Same as `get -c'.

       <b>rels</b> [<i>args</i>]

       Same as `ls', but ignores the cache.

       <b>renlist</b> [<i>args</i>]

       Same as `nlist', but ignores the cache.

       <b>repeat</b> [<i>OPTS</i>] [[<b>-d</b>] <i>delay</i>] [<i>command</i>]

       Repeat specified command with a delay between  iterations.   Default  delay  is  one  second,
       default command is empty.

            -c &lt;count&gt;    maximum number of iterations
            -d &lt;delay&gt;    delay between iterations
            --while-ok    stop when command exits with non-zero code
            --until-ok    stop when command exits with zero code
            --weak        stop when lftp moves to background.

       Examples:
            repeat at tomorrow -- mirror
            repeat 1d mirror

       <b>reput</b> <i>lfile</i> [<b>-o</b> <i>rfile</i>]

       Same as `put -c'.

       <b>rm</b> [<b>-r</b>] [<b>-f</b>] <i>files</i>

       Remove remote files.  Does not expand wildcards, use <b>mrm</b> for that. -r is for recursive direc‐
       tory remove. Be careful, if something goes wrong you can lose files. -f suppress  error  mes‐
       sages.

       <b>rmdir</b> <i>dir(s)</i>

       Remove remote directories.

       <b>scache</b> [<i>session</i>]

       List cached sessions or switch to specified session.

       <b>set</b> [<i>var</i> [<i>val</i>]]

       Set  variable to given value. If the value is omitted, unset the variable.  Variable name has
       format ``name/closure'', where closure can specify exact  application  of  the  setting.  See
       below  for details.  If set is called with no variable then only altered settings are listed.
       It can be changed by options:

            -a   list all settings, including default values
            -d   list only default values, not necessary current ones

       <b>site</b> <i>site</i>_<i>cmd</i>

       Execute site command <i>site</i>_<i>cmd</i> and output the result.  You can redirect its output.

       <b>sleep</b> <i>interval</i>

       Sleep given time interval and exit. Interval is in seconds by default, but  can  be  suffixed
       with 'm', 'h', 'd' for minutes, hours and days respectively.  See also <b>at</b>.

       <b>slot</b> [<i>name</i>]

       Select  specified slot or list all slots allocated. A slot is a connection to a server, some‐
       what like a virtual console. You can create multiple slots connected to different servers and
       switch between them. You can also use <i>slot:name</i> as a pseudo-URL evaluating to that slot loca‐
       tion.

       Default readline binding allows quick switching between slots named 0-9 using Meta-0 - Meta-9
       keys (often you can use Alt instead of Meta).

       <b>source</b> <i>file</i>
       <b>source</b> <b>-e</b> <i>command</i>

       Execute commands recorded in file <i>file</i> or returned by specified external command.
            source ~/.lftp/rc
            source -e echo help

       <b>suspend</b>

       Stop  lftp  process.  Note that transfers will be also stopped until you continue the process
       with shell's fg or bg commands.

       <b>torrent</b> [<b>OPTS</b>] <i>torrent-files...</i>

       Start BitTorrent process for the given <i>torrent-files</i>, which can be a local file or URL. Local
       wildcards  are  expanded.  Existing  files are first validated unless <i>--force-valid</i> option is
       given. Missing pieces are downloaded. Files are stored  in  specified  <i>directory</i>  or  current
       working directory by default. Seeding continues until ratio reachs <i>torrent:stop-on-ratio</i> set‐
       ting or time of <i>torrent:seed-max-time</i> outs.

       Options:

            -O &lt;directory&gt;   specifies base directory where files should be placed
            --force-valid    skip file validation (if you are sure they are ok).

       <b>user</b> <i>user</i> [<i>pass</i>]
       <b>user</b> <i>URL</i> [<i>pass</i>]

       Use specified info for remote login. If you specify an URL with user name, the entered  pass‐
       word will be cached so that future URL references can use it.

       <b>version</b>

       Print <b>lftp</b> version.

       <b>wait</b> [<i>jobno</i>]
       <b>wait</b> <b>all</b>

       Same as cat, but filter each file through zcat. (See also <b>cat</b>, <b>more</b> and <b>zmore</b>)

       <b>zmore</b> <i>files</i>

       Same as more, but filter each file through zcat. (See also <b>cat</b>, <b>zcat</b> and <b>more</b>)


   <b>Settings</b>
       On startup, lftp executes <i>~/.lftprc</i> and <i>~/.lftp/rc</i>.  You can place aliases and `set' commands
       there. Some people prefer to see full protocol debug, use `debug' to turn the debug on.

       There is also a system-wide startup file in <i>/etc/lftp.conf</i>.  It can be  in  different  direc‐
       tory, see FILES section.

       <b>lftp</b> has the following settable variables (you can also use `set -a' to see all variables and
       their values):

       <b>bmk:save-passwords</b> (boolean)

       <b>cmd:csh-history</b> (boolean)
              enables csh-like history expansion.

       <b>cmd:default-protocol</b> (string)
              The value is used when `open' is used with just host name without protocol. Default is
              `ftp'.

       <b>cmd:fail-exit</b> (boolean)
              if true, exit when an unconditional (without || and &amp;&amp; at begin) command fails.

       <b>cmd:interactive</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp acts interactively, handles terminal signals and  outputs  some  extra
              messages. Default depends on stdin being a terminal.

       <b>cmd:long-running</b> (seconds)
              time  of  command  execution,  which is considered as `long' and a beep is done before
              next prompt. 0 means off.

       <b>cmd:move-background-detach</b> (boolean)
              when true (default), lftp detaches itself from the control  terminal  when  moving  to
              background,  it  is  possible  to attach back using `attach' command; when false, lftp
              tricks the shell to move lftp to background process group and continues to  run,  then
              fg shell command brings lftp back to foreground unless it has done all jobs and termi‐
              nated.

       <b>cmd:prompt</b> (string)
              The prompt. lftp recognizes the following backslash-escaped  special  characters  that
              are decoded as follows:
              <b>\@</b>     insert @ if current user is not default
              <b>\a</b>     an ASCII bell character (07)
              <b>\e</b>     an ASCII escape character (033)

              <b>\\</b>     a backslash
              <b>\?</b>     skips next character if previous substitution was empty.
              <b>\[</b>     begin  a  sequence  of  non-printing characters, which could be used to embed a
                     terminal control sequence into the prompt
              <b>\]</b>     end a sequence of non-printing characters


       <b>cmd:parallel</b> (number)
              Number of jobs run in parallel in non-interactive mode. For example, this may be  use‐
              ful  for  scripts  with  multiple  `get'  commands.  Note that setting this to a value
              greater than 1 changes conditional execution behaviour, basically makes  it  inconsis‐
              tent.

       <b>cmd:queue-parallel</b> (number)
              Number of jobs run in parallel in a queue.

       <b>cmd:save-cwd-history</b> (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  saves  last CWD of each site to <i>~/.lftp/cwd</i>_<i>history</i>, allowing to do
              ``cd -'' after lftp restart. Default is true.

       <b>cmd:save-rl-history</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp saves readline history to  <i>~/.lftp/rl</i>_<i>history</i>  on  exit.   Default  is
              true.

       <b>cmd:set-term-status</b> (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  updates  terminal status if supported (e.g. xterm). The closure for
              this setting is the terminal type from TERM environment variable.

       <b>cmd:status-interval</b> (time<b>interval)</b>
              the time interval between status updates.

       <b>cmd:stifle-rl-history</b> (number)

       <b>cmd:term-status</b> (string)
              the format string to use to display terminal status. The closure for this  setting  is
              the  terminal  type  from  TERM environment variable. Default uses ``tsl'' and ``fsl''
              termcap values.

              The following escapes are supported:

                   \a   bell
                   \e   escape
                   \n   new line
                   \s   "lftp"
                   \v   lftp version
                   \T   the status string

       <b>cmd:time-style</b> (string)
              This setting is the default value for cls --time-style option.

       <b>cmd:trace</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp prints the commands it executes (like sh -x).

       <b>cache:cache-empty-listings</b> (boolean)
              When false, empty listings are not cached.

       <b>cache:enable</b> (boolean)
              When false, cache is disabled.

       <b>cache:expire</b> (time interval)
              Positive cache entries expire in this time interval.

       <b>cache:expire-negative</b> (time interval)
              Negative cache entries expire in this time interval.

       <b>cache:size</b> (number)
              Maximum cache size. When exceeded, oldest cache entries will be removed from cache.

       <b>cmd:remote-completion</b> (boolean)
              a boolean to control whether or not lftp uses remote completion.

       <b>cmd:verify-host</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp resolves host name immediately in `open' command.  It is  also  possible
              to  skip  the  check  for a single `open' command if `&amp;' is given, or if ^Z is pressed
              during the check.

       <b>cmd:verify-path</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp checks the path given in `cd' command.  It is also possible to skip  the
              check for a single `cd' command if `&amp;' is given, or if ^Z is pressed during the check.
              Examples:
                   set cmd:verify-path/hftp://* false
                   cd directory &amp;

       <b>cmd:verify-path-cached</b> (boolean)
              When false, `cd' to a directory known from cache as existent will succeed immediately.
              Otherwise the verification will depend on cmd:verify-path setting.

       <b>color:use-color</b> (tri-boolean)
              when  true,  cls  command  and  completion  output  colored file listings according to
              color:dir-colors setting.  When set to auto, colors are used when output is  a  termi‐
              nal.

       <b>color:dir-colors</b> (string)
              file listing color description. By default the value of LS_COLORS environment variable
              is used. See dircolors(1).

       <b>dns:SRV-query</b> (boolean)
              query for SRV records and use them before gethostbyname. The SRV records are only used
              if port is not explicitly specified. See link1(RFC2052) for details.

       <b>dns:cache-enable</b> (boolean)
              enable DNS cache. If it is off, lftp resolves host name each time it reconnects.

       <b>dns:cache-expire</b> (time interval)
              time to live for DNS cache entries. It has format &lt;number&gt;&lt;unit&gt;+, e.g.  1d12h30m5s or
              just 36h. To disable expiration, set it to `inf' or `never'.

       <b>dns:cache-size</b> (number)
              maximum number of DNS cache entries.

       <b>dns:fatal-timeout</b> (time interval)
              limit the time for DNS queries. If DNS server is unavailable too long, lftp will  fail
              to resolve a given host name. Set to `never' to disable.

       <b>dns:order</b> (list of protocol names)
              sets  the  order  of  DNS queries. Default is ``inet6 inet'' which means first look up
              address in inet6 family, then inet and use them  in  that  order.   To  disable  inet6
              (AAAA) lookup, set this variable to ``inet''.

       <b>dns:use-fork</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp will fork before resolving host address. Default is true.

       <b>dns:max-retries</b> (number)
              If  zero, there is no limit on the number of times lftp will try to lookup an address.
              If &gt; 0, lftp will try only this number of times to look up an address of each  address
              family in dns:order.

       <b>file:charset</b> (string)
              local character set. It is set from current locale initially.

       <b>fish:charset</b> (string)
              the character set used by fish server in requests, replies and file listings.  Default
              is empty which means the same as local.

       <b>fish:connect-program</b> (string)
              the program to use for connecting to remote server. It should support `-l' option  for
              user  name, `-p' for port number. Default is `ssh -a -x'. You can set it to `rsh', for
              example.

       <b>fish:shell</b> (string)
              use specified shell on server side. Default is /bin/sh. On some systems, /bin/sh exits
              when  doing  cd to a non-existent directory. lftp can handle that but it has to recon‐
              nect. Set it to /bin/bash for such systems if bash is installed.

       <b>ftp:acct</b> (string)
              Send this string in ACCT command after login. The result is ignored.  The closure  for
              this setting has format <i>user@host</i>.

       <b>ftp:anon-pass</b> (string)
              sets the password used for anonymous ftp access authentication.  Default is "lftp@".

       <b>ftp:anon-user</b> (string)
              sets  the  user name used for anonymous ftp access authentication.  Default is "anony‐
              mous".

       <b>ftp:auto-sync-mode</b> (regex)
              if first server message matches this regex, turn on sync mode for that host.

       <b>ftp:charset</b> (string)
              the character set used by ftp server in requests, replies and file listings.   Default
              is empty which means the same as local. This setting is only used when the server does
              not support UTF8.

       <b>ftp:client</b> (string)
              the name of ftp client to send with CLNT command, if supported by server.   If  it  is
              empty, then no CLNT command will be sent.

       <b>ftp:bind-data-socket</b> (boolean)
              bind data socket to the interface of control connection (in passive mode).  Default is
              true, exception is the loopback interface.

       <b>ftp:fix-pasv-address</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp will try to correct address returned by server for PASV command in  case
              when  server  address  is in public network and PASV returns an address from a private
              network. In this case lftp would substitute server address instead of the one returned
              by PASV command, port number would not be changed.  Default is true.

       <b>ftp:fxp-passive-source</b> (boolean)
              if  true,  lftp  will try to set up source ftp server in passive mode first, otherwise
              destination one. If first attempt fails, lftp tries to set them up the other  way.  If
              the other disposition fails too, lftp falls back to plain copy. See also ftp:use-fxp.

       <b>ftp:home</b> (string)
              Initial  directory.  Default  is empty string which means auto. Set this to `/' if you
              don't like the look of %2F in ftp URLs.  The  closure  for  this  setting  has  format
              <i>user@host</i>.

       <b>ftp:ignore-pasv-address</b> (boolean)
              If  true,  lftp  uses  control  connection address instead of the one returned in PASV
              reply for data connection. This can be useful for broken NATs.  Default is false.

       <b>ftp:list-empty-ok</b> (boolean)
              if set to false, empty lists from LIST command  will  be  treated  as  incorrect,  and
              another method (NLST) will be used.

       <b>ftp:list-options</b> (string)
              sets  options  which are always appended to LIST command. It can be useful to set this
              to `-a' if server does not show dot (hidden) files by default.  Default is empty.

       <b>ftp:nop-interval</b> (seconds)
              delay between NOOP commands when downloading tail of a file. This is  useful  for  ftp
              servers  which send "Transfer complete" message before flushing data transfer. In such
              cases NOOP commands can prevent connection timeout.

       <b>ftp:passive-mode</b> (boolean)
              sets passive ftp mode. This can be useful if you are behind a firewall or a dumb  mas‐
              querading  router.  In passive mode lftp uses PASV command, not the PORT command which
              is used in active mode. In passive mode lftp itself makes the data connection  to  the
              server;  in active mode the server connects to lftp for data transfer. Passive mode is
              the default.

       <b>ftp:port-ipv4</b> (ipv4 address)
              specifies an IPv4 address to send with PORT command. Default is empty which  means  to
              send the address of local end of control connection.

       <b>ftp:port-range</b> (from-to)
              allowed port range for active mode.  Format is min-max, or `full' or `any' to indicate
              any port. Default is `full'.

       <b>ftp:prefer-epsv</b> (boolean)
              use EPSV as preferred passive mode. Default is `false'.

       <b>ftp:proxy</b> (URL)
              specifies ftp proxy to use.  To disable proxy set this to empty string. Note  that  it
              is  an  ftp  proxy  which uses ftp protocol, not ftp over http. Default value is taken
              from environment variable <b>ftp</b>_<b>proxy</b> if it starts with ``ftp://''. If  your  ftp  proxy
              requires  authentication,  specify  user  name  and password in the URL.  If ftp:proxy
              starts with http:// then hftp protocol (ftp over http proxy) is used  instead  of  ftp
              automatically.

       <b>ftp:proxy-auth-type</b> (string)
              When set to ``joined'', lftp sends ``user@proxy_user@ftp.example.org'' as user name to
              proxy, and ``password@proxy_password'' as password.

              When set to ``joined-acct'',  lftp  sends  ``user@ftp.example.org  proxy_user''  (with
              space)  as  user name to proxy. The site password is sent as usual and the proxy pass‐
              word is expected in the following ACCT command.

              When set to ``open'', lftp first sends proxy user and proxy password and  then  ``OPEN
              ftp.example.org'' followed by ``USER user''.  The site password is then sent as usual.

              When  set  to  ``user''  (default), lftp first sends proxy user and proxy password and
              then ``user@ftp.example.org'' as user name.  The site password is then sent as usual.

              When set to ``proxy-user@host'', lftp first sends ``USER proxy_user@ftp.example.org'',
              then proxy password. The site user and password are then sent as usual.

       <b>ftp:rest-list</b> (boolean)
              allow usage of REST command before LIST command. This might be useful for large direc‐
              tories, but some ftp servers silently ignore REST before LIST.

       <b>ftp:rest-stor</b> (boolean)
              if false, lftp will not try to use REST before STOR. This can be useful for some buggy
              servers which corrupt (fill with zeros) the file if REST followed by STOR is used.

       <b>ftp:retry-530</b> (regex)
              Retry  on  server  reply 530 for PASS command if text matches this regular expression.
              This setting should be useful to distinguish between overloaded server (temporary con‐
              dition) and incorrect password (permanent condition).

       <b>ftp:retry-530-anonymous</b> (regex)
              Additional regular expression for anonymous login, like ftp:retry-530.

       <b>ftp:site-group</b> (string)
              Send  this  string in SITE GROUP command after login. The result is ignored.  The clo‐
              sure for this setting has format <i>user@host</i>.

       <b>ftp:skey-allow</b> (boolean)
              allow sending skey/opie reply if server appears to support it. On by default.

       <b>ftp:skey-force</b> (boolean)
              do not send plain text password over the network, use skey/opie instead. If  skey/opie
              is not available, assume failed login. Off by default.

       <b>ftp:ssl-allow</b> (boolean)
              if  true,  try  to  negotiate SSL connection with ftp server for non-anonymous access.
              Default is true. This and other ssl settings are only available if lftp  was  compiled
              with an ssl/tls library.

       <b>ftp:ssl-data-use-keys</b> (boolean)
              if  true,  lftp  loads  ssl:key-file for protected data connection too. When false, it
              does not, and the server can  match  data  and  control  connections  by  session  ID.
              Default is true.

       <b>ftp:ssl-force</b> (boolean)
              if  true,  refuse to send password in clear when server does not support SSL.  Default
              is false.

       <b>ftp:ssl-protect-data</b> (boolean)
              if true, request ssl connection for data transfers. This is cpu-intensive but provides
              privacy. Default is false.

       <b>ftp:ssl-protect-fxp</b> (boolean)
              if true, request ssl connection for data transfer between two ftp servers in FXP mode.
              CPSV or SSCN command will be used in that case. If ssl connection fails for some  rea‐
              son,  lftp  would  try unprotected FXP transfer unless ftp:ssl-force is set for any of
              the two servers. Default is false.

       <b>ftp:ssl-protect-list</b> (boolean)
              if true, request ssl connection for file list transfers. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:ssl-use-ccc</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp would issue CCC command after logon, thus disable ssl  protection  layer
              on control connection.

       <b>ftp:stat-interval</b> (time interval)
              interval between STAT commands. Default is 1 second.

       <b>ftp:sync-mode</b> (boolean)
              if  true,  lftp  will  send one command at a time and wait for response. This might be
              useful if you are using a buggy ftp server or router. When it is  off,  lftp  sends  a
              pack of commands and waits for responses - it speeds up operation when round trip time
              is significant.  Unfortunately it does not work with all ftp servers and some  routers
              have troubles with it, so it is on by default.

       <b>ftp:timezone</b> (string)
              Assume  this timezone for time in listings returned by LIST command.  This setting can
              be GMT  offset  [+|-]HH[:MM[:SS]]  or  any  valid  TZ  value  (e.g.  Europe/Moscow  or
              MSK-3MSD,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3).  The  default  is GMT.  Set it to an empty value to assume
              local timezone specified by environment variable TZ.

       <b>ftp:trust-feat</b> (string)
              When true, assume that FEAT returned data are correct and don't  use  common  protocol
              extensions like SIZE, MDTM, REST if they are not listed.  Default is false.

       <b>ftp:use-abor</b> (boolean)
              if false, lftp does not send ABOR command but closes data connection immediately.

       <b>ftp:use-allo</b> (boolean)
              when true (default), lftp sends ALLO command before uploading a file.

       <b>ftp:use-feat</b> (boolean)
              when  true  (default),  lftp  uses  FEAT command to determine extended features of ftp
              server.

       <b>ftp:use-fxp</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp will try to set up direct connection between two ftp servers.

       <b>ftp:use-hftp</b> (boolean)
              when ftp:proxy points to an http proxy, this setting selects hftp method  (GET,  HEAD)
              when true, and CONNECT method when false. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:use-ip-tos</b> (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  uses IPTOS_LOWDELAY for control connection and IPTOS_THROUGHPUT for
              data connections.

       <b>ftp:lang</b> (boolean)
              the language selected with LANG command, if supported as indicated by  FEAT  response.
              Default is empty which means server default.

       <b>ftp:use-mdtm</b> (boolean)
              when true (default), lftp uses MDTM command to determine file modification time.

       <b>ftp:use-mdtm-overloaded</b> (boolean)
              when  true,  lftp  uses  two  argument  MDTM  command to set file modification time on
              uploaded files. Default is false.

       <b>ftp:use-site-idle</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp sends `SITE IDLE' command with net:idle argument. Default is false.

       <b>ftp:use-site-utime</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp sends 5-argument `SITE UTIME' command to set file modification time on
              uploaded files. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:use-site-utime2</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp sends 2-argument `SITE UTIME' command to set file modification time on
              uploaded files. Default is true.  If 5-argument `SITE UTIME' is also enabled,  2-argu‐
              ment command is tried first.

       <b>ftp:use-size</b> (boolean)
              when true (default), lftp uses SIZE command to determine file size.

       <b>ftp:use-stat</b> (boolean)
              if  true,  lftp sends STAT command in FXP mode transfer to know how much data has been
              transferred. See also ftp:stat-interval. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:use-stat-for-list</b> (boolean)
              when true, lftp uses STAT instead of LIST command. By default  `.'  is  used  as  STAT
              argument. Using STAT, lftp avoids creating data connection for directory listing. Some
              servers require special options for STAT, use ftp:list-options to specify  them  (e.g.
              <b>-la</b>).

       <b>ftp:use-telnet-iac</b> (boolean)
              when true (default), lftp uses TELNET IAC command and follows TELNET protocol as spec‐
              ified in link1(RFC959). When false, it does not follow TELNET protocol and thus does not dou‐
              ble  255 (0xFF, 0377) character and does not prefix ABOR and STAT commands with TELNET
              IP+SYNCH signal.

       <b>ftp:use-tvfs</b> (tri-boolean)
              When set to auto, usage of TVFS feature depends on FEAT server reply.  Otherwise  this
              setting  tells whether use it or not. In short, if a server supports TVFS feature then
              it uses unix-like paths.

       <b>ftp:use-quit</b> (boolean)
              if true, lftp sends QUIT before disconnecting from ftp server. Default is true.

       <b>ftp:verify-address</b> (boolean)
              verify that data connection comes from the network address of control connection peer.
              This  can possibly prevent data connection spoofing which can lead to data corruption.
              Unfortunately, this can fail for certain ftp servers with several network  interfaces,
              when they do not set outgoing address on data socket, so it is disabled by default.

       <b>ftp:verify-port</b> (boolean)
              verify that data connection has port 20 (ftp-data) on its remote end.  This can possi‐
              bly prevent data connection spoofing by users of remote host. Unfortunately, too  many
              windows  and  even unix ftp servers forget to set proper port on data connection, thus
              this check is off by default.

       <b>ftp:web-mode</b> (boolean)
              disconnect after closing data connection. This can be useful for  totally  broken  ftp
              servers. Default is false.

       <b>ftps:initial-prot</b> (string)
              specifies  initial PROT setting for FTPS connections. Should be one of: C, S, E, P, or
              empty. Default is empty which means unknown, so that lftp will use PROT command uncon‐
              ditionally.  If  PROT  command  turns  out to be unsupported, then Clear mode would be
              assumed.

       <b>hftp:cache</b> (boolean)
              allow server/proxy side caching for ftp-over-http protocol.

       <b>hftp:cache-control</b> (string)
              specify corresponding HTTP request header.

       <b>hftp:proxy</b> (URL)
              specifies http proxy for ftp-over-http protocol (hftp). The protocol hftp cannot  work
              without  a  http  proxy,  obviously.  Default value is taken from environment variable
              <b>ftp</b>_<b>proxy</b>  if  it  starts  with  ``http://'',  otherwise  from  environment   variable
              <b>http</b>_<b>proxy</b>.  If your ftp proxy requires authentication, specify user name and password
              in the URL.

       <b>hftp:use-authorization</b> (boolean)
              if set to off, lftp will send password as part of  URL  to  the  proxy.  This  may  be
              required for some proxies (e.g. M-soft). Default is on, and lftp will send password as
              part of Authorization header.

       <b>hftp:use-head</b> (boolean)
              if set to off, lftp will try to use `GET' instead of `HEAD' for hftp protocol.   While
              this  is slower, it may allow lftp to work with some proxies which don't understand or
              mishandle ``HEAD ftp://'' requests.

       <b>hftp:use-mkcol</b> (boolean)
              if set to off, lftp will try to use `PUT' instead of  `MKCOL'  to  create  directories
              with hftp protocol. Default is off.

       <b>hftp:use-propfind</b> (boolean)
              if set to off, lftp will not try to use `PROPFIND' to get directory contents with hftp
              protocol and use `GET' instead. Default is off.

       <b>hftp:use-type</b> (boolean)
              If set to off, lftp won't try to append `;type=' to URLs passed to proxy.  Some broken

              transfer  files  matching  *.sfv  first,  then  ones matching *.sum and then all other
              files. To process directories after other files, add "*/" to end of pattern list.

       <b>mirror:parallel-directories</b> (boolean)
              if true, mirror will start processing of several directories in parallel when it is in

              numbers separated by colon to limit download and upload rate  separately.   Note  that
              sockets  have  receive buffers on them, this can lead to network link load higher than
              this rate limit just after transfer beginning. You can try to set net:socket-buffer to
              relatively small value to avoid this.

       <b>net:limit-total-max</b> (bytes)
              limit accumulating of unused limit-total-rate. 0 means twice of limit-total-rate.

       <b>net:reconnect-interval-max</b> (seconds)
              sets  maximum  reconnect  interval.  When  current  interval  after  multiplication by
              net:reconnect-interval-multiplier reachs this value (or exceeds it), it is reset  back
              to net:reconnect-interval-base.

       <b>net:reconnect-interval-multiplier</b> (real number)
              sets  multiplier by which base interval is multiplied each time new attempt to perform
              an operation fails. When the interval reachs maximum, it is reset to base  value.  See
              net:reconnect-interval-base and net:reconnect-interval-max.

       <b>net:socket-bind-ipv4</b> (ipv4 address)
              bind  all  IPv4  sockets to specified address. This can be useful to select a specific
              network interface to use. Default is empty which means not to bind IPv4 sockets, oper‐
              ating system will choose an address automatically using routing table.

       <b>net:socket-bind-ipv6</b> (ipv6 address)
              the same for IPv6 sockets.

       <b>net:socket-buffer</b> (bytes)

              error instead.

       <b>xfer:destination-directory</b> (path or URL to directory)
              This setting is used as default -O option for  get  and  mget  commands.   Default  is
              empty, which means current directory (no -O option).

       <b>xfer:disk-full-fatal</b> (boolean)
              when  true, lftp aborts a transfer if it cannot write target file because of full disk
              or quota; when false, lftp waits for disk space to be freed.

       <b>xfer:eta-period</b> (seconds)

              integrity. Zero exit code of that command should indicate correctness of the file.

       <b>xfer:verify-command</b> (string)
              the command to validate file integrity. The only argument is the path to the file.


       The  name of a variable can be abbreviated unless it becomes ambiguous. The prefix before `:'
       can be omitted too. You can set one variable several times for different closures,  and  thus
       you  can get a particular settings for particular state. The closure is to be specified after
       variable name separated with slash `/'.

       The closure for `dns:', `net:', `ftp:', `http:', `hftp:' domain variables is  currently  just
       the  host name as you specify it in the `open' command (with some exceptions where closure is
       meaningless, e.g. dns:cache-size).  For some `cmd:' domain variables the closure  is  current
       URL  without  path.  For other variables it is not currently used. See examples in the sample
       <i>lftp.conf</i>.

       Certain commands and settings take a time interval parameter. It has  the  format  Nx[Nx...],
       where N is time amount (floating point) and x is time unit: d - days, h - hours, m - minutes,
       s - seconds. Default unit is second. E.g. 5h30m or 5.5h.  Also the interval  can  be  `infin‐
       ity',  `inf',  `never',  `forever' - it means infinite interval. E.g. `sleep forever' or `set
       dns:cache-expire never'.

       Boolean settings can be one of (true, on, yes, 1, +) for a True value or one of (false,  off,
       no, 0, -) for a False value.

       Tri-boolean settings have either a boolean value or `auto'.

       Integer  settings can have a suffix: k - kibi, m - mebi, g - gigi, etc.  They can also have a
       prefix: 0 - octal, 0x - hexadecimal.


   <b>FTP</b> <b>asynchronous</b> <b>mode</b> <b>(pipelining)</b>
       <b>Lftp</b> can speed up ftp operations by sending several commands at once and  then  checking  all
       the  responses.  See  ftp:sync-mode  variable. Sometimes this does not work, thus synchronous
       mode is the default. You can try to turn synchronous mode off and see if it works for you. It
       is known that some network software dealing with address translation works incorrectly in the
       case of several FTP commands in one network packet.

       <a href="http://lftp.yar.ru/RFC959">RFC959</a> says: ``The user-process sending another command before the completion reply would  be
       in  violation  of  protocol;  but  server-FTP processes should queue any commands that arrive
       while a preceding command is in progress''.  Also,  <a href="http://lftp.yar.ru/RFC1123">RFC1123</a>  says:  ``Implementors  MUST  NOT
       assume  any  correspondence  between READ boundaries on the control connection and the Telnet
       EOL sequences (CR LF).'' and ``a single READ from the control  connection  may  include  more
       than one FTP command''.

       So  it  must  be  safe  to send several commands at once, which speeds up operation a lot and
       seems to work with all Unix and VMS based ftp servers. Unfortunately, windows  based  servers
       often cannot handle several commands in one packet, and so cannot some broken routers.


<b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-d</b>     Switch on debugging mode.

       <b>-e</b> <i>commands</i>
              Execute given commands and don't exit.

       <b>-u</b> <i>user</i>[<b>,</b><i>pass</i>]
              Use  the  given username and password to connect. Remember to quote the password prop‐
              erly in the shell.  Also note that it is not secure to specify the password on command
              line,  use  <i>~/.netrc</i>  file.  Alternatively you can use ssh-based protocols with autho‐
              rized keys, so you don't have to enter a password.

       <b>-f</b> <i>script</i>_<i>file</i>

              arguments.

       <b>-c</b> <i>commands</i>
              Execute  the given commands and exit. Commands can be separated with a semicolon, `&amp;&amp;'
              or `||'. Remember to quote the commands argument properly in the shell.   This  option
              must be used alone without other arguments.
